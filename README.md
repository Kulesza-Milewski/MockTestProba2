## INTRODUCTION

If there’s any preconception about the post-communist cities of Eastern Europe that Kraków entirely disproves, it’s that they have a poor public transport system, or that it’s difficult to get around the place. It’s an image that has perhaps been perpetuated by the traditional grainy, black and whites of post-war cobbled Kraków, where clanking, antique trams still glide slowly down the street, and those curiously bug-looking trolleybuses unique to Europe splutter their way through the traffic. One thing visitors to Kraków usually notice pretty quickly is that’s totally wrong.

Recently Kraków has actually won awards for the quality of its public transport, which, while not incorporating an underground at all, is a very comprehensive network of high quality buses and trams, penetrating right to the edges of the city’s boundaries – from the Airport village of Balice in the west, to the suburb of Płaszów in the east.

On arrival, many people who are visiting Kraków for the first time don’t even consider getting the bus into town. But, while the taxi ranks may be closer to the terminal exit, the ride is typically 25 times more expensive, far less comfortable, and, depending on the destination, often longer. Head to the bus stop that’s just to the left of the terminal exit and jump on any bus; they all head to the centre, and have real time maps on board that will give you the name of each stop long before you arrive.
